              A homage to the creation of Pavel Durov, founder of TON - The Open
              Network and Telegram, Resistance Dog ($REDO), is a symbolic
              representation of our fight against censorship and freedom through
              digital resistance. Created in 2018 by Durov, our logo is the
              (un)official mascot of Telegram, and is at the forefront of
              Telegram’s consistent efforts to battle censorship by governments
              and multinational companies trying to restrict the ability of
              people to express themselves freely in digital media.

              In the gritty streets of Brooklyn, Tired Trett, an opossum with a
              heart full of resilience, navigates life with his four mischievous
              adopted sons: Pepe, a cunning frog; Brett, a mysterious blue
              creature; Andy, a rambunctious dog; and WOLF, a spirited landwolf.
              Trett's journey as a single father began when his wife left,
              leaving him to raise the boys alone. Their home is a makeshift
              haven near a garbage can, where they survive by scavenging for
              food and treasures. Their possessions tell a story of hardship and
              hope: Pepe's half-broken computer, Andy's almost completely
              ripped-apart book, Brett's collection of mismatched shoes, and
              WOLF's prized, slightly functional flashlight. Among their
              discoveries is ZEUS, an autistic dog they found behind a trashcan
              when the children were young. Moved by compassion, they took ZEUS
              in, not wanting the helpless dog to die alone. ZEUS has since kind
              off become a part of their family. Trett, known as "Tired Trett"
              for his perpetual exhaustion, juggles multiple jobs to keep his
              boys fed and out of trouble. Despite the relentless grind, he
              works tirelessly as a janitor at TON Headquarters, his weary eyes
              always vigilant for his sons' next misadventure. The boys, known
              as the "Boys Club Gang," often add to Trett's woes by stealing
              money from his wallet to gamble on degenerate memecoins and play
              dice on the streets. Yet, through sheer perseverance and an
              indomitable spirit, Trett manages to create his own memecoin,
              aptly named Tired Trett, on the TON chain. This stroke of
              ingenuity turns their family's fortunes around, offering a glimmer
              of hope amidst the chaos of their lives. Despite the constant
              struggle and the boys' endless antics, Tired Trett's unwavering
              love and determination shine through, binding their unconventional
              family together against all odds.
